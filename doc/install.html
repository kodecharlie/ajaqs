<title>Installing Ajaqs</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Install the source distribution</h2>
Make sure you have downloaded all of the
<a href="about.html#technologies">required technologies</a>
somewhere on your computer.  Then follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Unzip the source bundle in some read/write-able location
      on your computer.  For purposes of explanation, let us assume
      that directory is called <em>ajaqs</em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Modify <tt>ajaqs/build.properties</tt> to reflect the location
      of various <tt>.jar</tt> files on your computer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Copy <tt>c.tld</tt>, <tt>fmt.tld</tt>, and <tt>fn.tld</tt>
      from the JSTL distribution and put them under <tt>ajaqs/web/WEB-INF</tt>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Copy <tt>request.tld</tt> from the jakarta-request-1.0.1
      distribution and put it under <tt>ajaqs/web/WEB-INF</tt>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Create back-end</h2>
To set up the back-end, do this:
<ol>
  <li><p>Make sure your database vendor is supported.  You can
  verify this by looking in the <tt>ajaqs/sql</tt> subdirectory
  and seeing if there is a directory there with SQL scripts for
  your vendor.</p></li>
  <li><p>Create the database you identified in <tt>build.properties</tt>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>Make sure a connection from your computer to the database
  is possible.</p></li>
  <li><p>Make sure the database administrator and user (and their
  passwords) that you specified in <tt>build.properties</tt>
  are properly set up in your database.  In particular, make
  sure these users have suitable access restrictions with
  respect to the database tables you intend to set up for Ajaqs.</p></li>
  <li><p>Run:  <tt>ant dbcreate -f build.xml</tt>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Run:  <tt>ant dbinit -f build.xml</tt>.  This will create
  various tables in the database.  See the <a href="ermodel.html">
  Ajaqs E-R Model</a> for a more thorough explanation of what data
  is represented by the tables.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Testing the back-end</h2>
This is an optional step mainly intended for developers.
If you wish to validate your <tt>database.xml</tt> configuration,
follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li><p>Download the jar file for <tt>Jakarta Commons Logging</tt>.
  Put the jar file in some place where it will be found when Ajaqs
  starts.  In my setup, I just copied the jar file into
  <tt>/path/to/tomcat/common/lib</tt>.  <b>NOTE:</b>  when you
  are finished with testing the back-end, move the
  <tt>Jakarta Commons Logging</tt> jar file out of Tomcat's
  <tt>common/lib</tt>.  It is not required for Ajaqs, and it may
  lead to exceptions when Ajaqs starts (which is what I observed
  on my setup).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Modify <tt>build.properties</tt> and set correct file
  locations for the <tt>xerces.jar</tt> and <tt>commons.logging.jar</tt>
  properties.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Run <tt>ant xmlinit</tt> to set up XML configuration files
  under the <tt>build</tt> sub-directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Run <tt>ant test</tt>.  This test will load <tt>database.xml</tt>
  and try to set a few records in your database.  If something goes
  wrong, then it is likely some part of your setup needs to be
  corrected.  Be cautioned that when you run this test more than once,
  you may run into errors.  You can work around this problem by
  always clearing the database before running <tt>ant test</tt>.
  See the source file <tt>test/com/beardediris/ajaqs/db/MappingTest.java</tt>
  for details.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Initialize Ajaqs</h2>
<p>At this point, you should initialize the back-end with certain
data required by Ajaqs at startup.  This includes an initial
set of users, roles, projects, and FAQs.  Eventually, you
will be able to create much of this data from a browser,
provided you have admin priveleges; as of this writing, such
support is not available.</p>

<p>To prime the Ajaqs back-end with test-data, run
<tt>ant dbinsert -f build.xml</tt>.  This uses the SQL
script <tt>ajaqs/sql/mysql/insert_data.sql</tt> to load
various test data in a MySql database.  For more specific
types of initial data, you will need to create your own SQL
script, similar to <tt>insert_data.sql</tt>, and use that
script to prime the Ajaqs back-end.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Configure webapp server</h2>
If you are using Tomcat, you should look at
<tt>ajaqs/xml/tomcat/server.xml</tt>.  Find the <em>Context</em>
in which the Ajaqs webapp is configured.  Put this <em>Context</em>
somewhere in your webapp server's configuration
file.  In Tomcat 5.x, such configuration is found in
<tt>tomcat/conf/server.xml</tt>.

<hr />
<h2>Pooling with MySQL</h2>
To pool connections to a MySQL database, take the
following steps:
<ol>
  <li><p>Download the jar files for <tt>Jakarta Commons DBCP</tt>,
    <tt>Jakarta Commons Pool</tt>, and <tt>Jakarta Commons Collections</tt>.
    See the <a href="about.html#technologies">required technologies</a>
    section for links to these packages.
  </li>
  <li><p>Put the jar files in the CLASSPATH for Ajaqs.  In my setup
    with Tomcat 5.x, I just copy the jar files into
    <tt>/path/to/tomcat/common/lib</tt>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>In the webapp configuration file <tt>ajaqs/web/WEB-INF/web.xml</tt>,
    make sure you specify <tt>databasePooled.xml</tt>, rather than
    <tt>database.xml</tt>, in the appropriate place so that you use
    the pooling configuration.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h2>Pooling with PostgreSQL</h2>
To pool connections to a PostgreSQL database, just specify
the <tt>postgresql.xml</tt> configuration in the <tt>mapping.xml</tt>
file; this setup provides JDBC pooling.  I have not yet tested
this configuration against PostgreSQL as of Ajaqs version 1.1.2.
