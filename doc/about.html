<h2>What is Ajaqs</h2>
<p>Ajaqs is a web-based application used to warehouse FAQs
on a per-project basis.  In that sense, it functions like
the original FAQ-o-matic, written by Jon Howell.</p>

<h2>The original FAQ-o-matic</h2>
<p>I first used the original FAQ-o-matic at apache.org in 1999
when I was working for a company called MATRAnet in San Carlos,
California.  I found the online question-and-answer forum
very helpful.  At the time, I was becoming familiar with
Internet technologies and Java tools (like servlets), and
thought it would be interesting to re-implement the FAQ-o-matic
as a servlet application.  So, finally finding some spare
time in Africa (where I work as a Peace Corps Volunteer
in Uganda), I've done it.  Ajaqs is the result.</p>

<h2>Ajaqs is Free Software</h2>
<p>Because of the tremendous effort of the Free Software
Foundation, and the role it has played in my own professional
development, I have felt compelled to donate this work
to the software community (please see <a href="license.html">
licensing details</a>).  My hope is that Ajaqs will
help engineering groups maintain and perpetuate their
knowledge-base.  In my own experience, one of the great
challenges of engineering a new project is not in fact
the project itself, but instead, the storage, transmission
(often to novices), and searching, of all the knowledge
that grows up around the project.  Companies have a
vested interest not only in making this knowledge readily
understood, but also stand to gain when their top-tier
engineers are spending time on new projects, not dealing
with questions on old ones.</p>

</ul>

<p>We use Castor for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>To make Ajaqs independent of the database vendor.  That is,
  Ajaqs in theory can be mapped onto a variety of database products,
  provided Castor supports the vendor in question.</p></li>
  <li><p>To support transactions.  That is, every page in Ajaqs is
  processed as a transaction, so either the whole page works fine
  and we commit (where need be) to the database, or we rollback
  and do not commit any changes at all.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The default configuration for Ajaqs relies on MySQL-Max.
We use INNODB tables, provided in MySQL-Max, in order to get
transactional behavior in the back-end.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Ajaqs</h2>
Here are some key advantages of using Ajaqs:
<ul>
  <li><p>Flexibility.  The end-user should be able to use any
  major commercial (or open-source) database on the market.
  Moreover, the end-user should be able to customize the
  look-and-feel of the front-end; this includes the ability
  to internationalize the application.</p></li>
  <li><p>Maintenance.  Both external documentation (like this)
  and inline javadocs should explain how things work.  I've
  tried to write clean Java code so that developers who build
  on Ajaqs will have a clear, easily extensible starting point.</p></li>
  <li><p>Ease of Use.  Installation is simple; you just have to
  create a .war file and drop it in the right directory/folder.
  The Ajaqs interface is text-based, and intended to provide easy
  access to search operations.</p></li>
  <li><p>Security.  File system security issues are completely
  off-loaded to the Java security model (i.e., the Java sandbox)
  and whatever access-policy may be in place for the database.
  Ajaqs-specific security in connection with particular web
  content is off-loaded to the security model for the application
  server under use.  Ajaqs-specific security that deals with
  end-users is role-based, and leverages Castor's JDO mapping
  model to restrict, automatically, what data from the back-end
  some end-user can access.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages of Ajaqs</h2>
<p>Here are some disadvantages of using Ajaqs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Castor.  Although this is a big design advantage, in practice
  it poses occasional problems, partly because of sketchy documentation.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>Non-trivial design.  Ajaqs may be powerful, but it comes
  at a great price.  As the list of technologies above indicates,
  it takes a well-versed Java developer to understand all the issues
  involved in making Ajaqs work properly.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Whence the name Ajaqs?</h2>
<p><em>Ajaqs</em> stands for <u>a</u> <u>J</u>ava F<u>AQ</u>-o-matic,
and is pronounced like the proper noun Ajax, which is the name
once given to a great warrior in ancient Greek mythology.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Here are some contributors who have helped make this package

  provided a place in Uganda where I can work in peace.</p></li>
  <li><p><a href="http://www.redhat.com">Redhat</a>, which supplied
  the free OS (Redhat 7.1) and superior development tools with which
  I wrote Ajaqs.</p></li>
</ul>
