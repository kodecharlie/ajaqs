<h1>Ajaqs Licensing</h1>

<p>I, Charles L. Read, the author of Ajaqs, own the copyright to Ajaqs.
Hence, I reserve the right to offer Ajaqs under two separate license
agreements, as follows:
<ul>
  <li><p>The first license under which Ajaqs is offered is the familiar
  GNU Library GPL; you can read that license agreement in the COPYING
  file found in the top-level directory of the source distribution.
  The main point of this license is that Ajaqs source code is completely
  at your disposal.  Do whatever you like with it, but if you decide
  to redistribute Ajaqs, you must publish any modifications you make
  to it.</p></li>
  <li><p>If the GNU GPL is too restrictive for your needs
  - that is, you plan to change Ajaqs and distribute some modified
  form of the software package, but you do not want to be bound
  by the GNU GPL - then please e-mail me and I will I offer you
  a version of Ajaqs under a separate license agreement for some
  nominal fee.</p></li>
</ul>
