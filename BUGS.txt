* Fix PDF downloads for MSIE (on projectpage.jsp).

* Deal with synchronization issues on edits?

* Add email button to error page.

* Maybe: fix tag setUserList so that the person logged in can
  optionally be included in the list.

* Need to be sure that behavior supported
  through administrative access, is gracefully coordinated with
  the user-experience.  Eg, if a new project (with nothing else)
  has just been created, make sure the end-user browsing the
  project sees reasonable outputs (Eg, no FAQs, etc).

* All of these problems are related:
  * Can we avoid the dirty="ignore" attribute in mapping.xml
    (except for blobs)?
  * LockNotGrantedException
    -> sometimes occurs when RecordLoginTime called.
  * There is a problem in many servlets where interaction with
    the DB can cause an exception, but no rollback is ever done.
  * For readLock Timeout problem, consider using read-only queries,
    where appropriate (on the hunch that that will eliminate write-
    contention).
  * EditUser.java - this works, but the edited user can no longer
    log in, without restarting Tomcat.

* Blobs in PostgreSQL 7.3.3 do not work.  See if Castor 0.9.5 fixes this.

* submitanswer.jsp
  - If we submit from browse.jsp, should jump back to
    question in browse.jsp where we submitted from.

* search.jsp
  - investigate FULL TEXT search through MySQL.
  - deal with issue of inserting HTML text in questions or answers
    (currently, the search algorithm does not know when it is within
    an HTML tag; ie, it continues to search text within markup tags).

* Add version number to dist target in build.xml.

* Make reload target work right in manager.xml. Right now, we
  have to restart tomcat every time a JSP is altered, because
  if we reload (or instead undeploy, then deploy again) the
  server.xml configuration is lost. In other words, tomcat
  can hot-deploy a web-application, but the server.xml context
  set up for that  web-application is not preserved.

* We need to subject this webapp to multiple, simultaneous queries;
  that way, we can see whether or not it behaves sensibly, and in
  particular, exhibits acceptable transactional behavior.  My concern
  is that a note in the Castor docs says that only one Database object
  should be used at one time.  Since TransactPage (our wrapper around
  almost all end-user interaction) gets a Database from the JDO, we
  could observe some problem with multiple, simultaneous accesses.
  This needs to be tested.

* Util.java - may need to change PUNCTUATION constant so that it
  is not US-ASCII specific.
